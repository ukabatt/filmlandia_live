            <p>Welcome to Filmlandia! We're Uka and Sandy, two sisters from Colorado now based in Boston and New York. We turned our childhood TV obsession into a full-blown passion project.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Growing up in Colorado as first-generation Mongolian-Americans, we often found ourselves home alone while our parents worked long hours. TV became our constant companion, but it was far more than entertainment. Film and media became our window to cross-cultural understanding, a space to explore our individual identities, and the spark that ignited our love for storytelling. We believe in media's power to shape worldviews, which is why we're passionate about contributing to this ongoing dialogue.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now, as twenty-something storytelling enthusiasts, we're sharing our perspectives on film and TV. Filmlandia is our platform to discuss the movies and shows that shaped our upbringing and continue to influence in adulthood. We analyze each piece through the lens of our unique backgrounds, exploring how media impacts us personally and shapes our world, identities, and understanding of the human experience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Join our blog and podcast as we dive into the magic of visual storytelling, offering insights that blend cultural analysis with our personal journeys.</p>
